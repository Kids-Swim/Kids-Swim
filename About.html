  Hello, friends!
  </p>
  <p>
  Welcome to our website!  It will look rather humble at first, but the goal for this project is sustainable growth; The more funds we acquire through your support, the more empowered we will be to improve your resources!
  </p>
  <p>
  So why are we doing this?
  </p>
  <p>
  There is a widening gap in aquatics education that can be extremely challenging to bridge through traditional means.
  </p>
    <p>
    While many community service organizations do a fantastic job providing both access to pools and as many swim lessons (and other aquatic programs) as they can muster the staff for, there are some realities that eventually catch up with aquatic program providers and limit their ability to focus on outreach opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
    For a brief overview of these challenges, please click here.
    </p>
      <ol>
      <li>
      Initial overhead -- hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and tens of thousands of dollars worth of chemicals are put into a pool before anyone even gets in. These funds need to be recouped as soon as possible and continuously recouped for sustainability.
      </li>
      <li>
      Staff -- no one wants to spend hours upon hours each week in or around a pool. The long-term side effects of lengthy and frequent exposures aren't worth the pay (and more often than not, the pay is very little anyway). Even young people eventually grow out of wanting to catch a tan every summer. The only exception I can think of is, in the rare case, when a union is recognized. Most aquatics folks try to minimize their in-water time by either moving their involvement to more trainer/office-oriented work or become part time (and support themselves financially through a completely separate occupation).
      </li>
      <li>
      Liability -- aquatics is considered a high-risk industry, not just for the potential of actual drowning or other serious injury, but also for the potential of sexual harrassment suits. The insurance premiums (and hopefully the incident reserve fund as well) are at the forefront of every aquatics budget.
      </li>
      </ol>
    <p>
    How aquatic program providers choose to meet these challenges impacts their communities differently.
    </p>
    <p>
    With the pressure to establish and maintain a return on investment so high, when times are tough, low-revenue programs are either the first to go or get funded by higher revenue programs.
    </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      In the first scenario, this means people who can't pay the higher margins lose access to services. As a result, aquatics activities become exclusively for the wealthy in any community where aquatic program providers choose to tighten their belts in this manner.
      </li>
      <li>
      In the second scenario, this means participants have to decide if they would like to give to the cause or take from it. Typically, there is some metric by which the availability of financial assistance is calculated.
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    Putting the squeeze on staffing is also a common decision.
    </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      In an industry where turnover is high to begin with and training costs are not insignificant, instituting a hiring freeze so staff who depart can't be replaced, instituting a pay freeze or otherwise suppressing merit increases so staff who work just as hard are effectively poorer when their wages don't keep up with inflation, and requiring a high number of hours per week worked to qualify for benefits, (just to name a few,) can all lead to canceled programs.
      </li>
      <li>
      If aquatic leadership winds up filling in for front line staff, their time and energy is taken away from working on other creative ways of meeting these challenges.
      </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    (In fact, I had to take an entire year off working in aquatics before I could recover from that vicious cycle enough to start this project.)
    </p>
  <p>
  Because I still have a soft spot for aquatics and enjoy teaching very much, I wanted to see if the community at large would be interested in helping us build solutions to fill the growing need for affordable aquatic education.

  If our local partners continue to focus on providing pools, we can focus on providing additional tools!

  What’s already out there?
  </p>
  <p>
  The following are free resources from reputable learn-to-swim organizations.
  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    The American Red Cross has long offered Longfellow’s WHALE tales as a free curriculum for teaching water safety. http://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/swimming/whale-tales/resources
    </li>
    <li>
    The Y likes to focus on offering free or low-cost mini swim lessons annually. Because the Y is a franchise, it’s difficult to point to a single site for their SPLASH! Program, but you can search for one in your local area.  http://www.ymca.net/watersafety/
    </li>
    <li>
    Many other outreach programs, especially those targeted toward higher-risk minority groups, are often grant-funded so that numerous organizations can get involved in delivering water safety programs.  Grant writing is very paperwork intensive, so unless an organization is big enough to have someone who specializes in grant writing (has honed the skill down to an art,) it can easily get lost in the low-priority list, especially when it looks like the amount of hours spent applying for and keeping the funds might exceed the amount of hours that would be spent delivering the program or service or the wages paid out might exceed the amount of the grant.
    </li>
    <li>
    Your city’s parks & recreation department might also offer water safety classes.
    </li>
    </ul>
  <p>
  There are, of course, any number of less reputable free resources as well, but I won’t go into them, since you can use a search engine to find them anytime you’re curious.
  </p>
  <p>
  So where are the gaps?
