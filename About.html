  Kids Swim University provides electronic tools and resources 
  to help promote water safety and swim instruction in the community.
  </p>
    <p class="pad">
    We find that organizations who own and operate pools 
    do a fine job providing physical resources 
    (equipment, instructors, etc.) 
    but don't often dedicate the time, energy, and focus 
    toward developing a library accessible to the public. 
    The various instruction manuals and worksheets they have developed 
    are stuck on VHS and, at best, DVDs that they only make available 
    to those who register for and attend a 30- to 40-hour training course. 
    So we are creating a website to make more resources available and bridge that gap. 
    The main objective there is to help parents 
    who already understand the value of swim lessons 
    and might even already have kids enrolled in lessons 
    get the most out of the time and money they are investing 
    by providing guidance for their between-lesson time.
